Plugins
=======

By using ``stginga``, the following plugins are also
available, in addition to the ones that already come with Ginga. Some are
customizable via plugin configuration files, which are available in the
`stginga/examples/configs <https://github.com/spacetelescope/stginga/tree/master/stginga/examples/configs>`_ directory.

.. _stginga-local-plugins:

Local Plugins
-------------

This plugin works with :ref:`global-plugin-multiimage` to display the same
object across multiple images:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   plugins_manual/mipick

These plugins behave like a regular Ginga plugin:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   plugins_manual/backgroundsub
   plugins_manual/badpixcorr
   plugins_manual/dqinspect
   plugins_manual/saveimage
   plugins_manual/snrcalc

These plugins are for very specific analysis needs. Therefore, they are
distributed but not loaded by default into the Ginga viewer. To load them,
one way is to use the ``--plugins`` option along with ``stginga`` command
(see :ref:`stginga-run`):

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   plugins_manual/mosaicauto


.. _stginga-global-plugins:

Global Plugins
--------------

This plugin works with :ref:`local-plugin-mipick` to display the same
object across multiple images:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   plugins_manual/multiimage
