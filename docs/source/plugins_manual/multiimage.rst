This global plugin is used to view a selected region of sky in multiple
images along the bottom of the main viewer.
Selection can be made using :ref:`local-plugin-mipick`.
If the box size and position change, all the postage stamps update dynamically.

Options include fixing the region either to sky coordinates, the
default, or to pixels (data).
